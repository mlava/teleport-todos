If you ever end your day with some of your {{[[TODO]]}} blocks in Roam still not {{[[DONE]]}}, this extension provides an easy way to send them to another daily note page to deal with then.

Using the Roam Research multi-block select (CTRL-m) choose the TODOs you want to teleport.

Then, trigger this extension using the Command Palette and 'Teleport TODOs'. A datepicker dialogue box will come up. Choose the date and you TODOs will teleport to that page in your graph.

If you happen to select a block that you've DONE, never fear as it won't be sent. Only the incomplete TODOs will move. Further, empty blocks or those that don't contain a {{[[TODO]]}} won't move either. No accidentally sending important data to another day!
